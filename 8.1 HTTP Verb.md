| HTTP Verb | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| `GET`     | Abused for information gathering and query string-based attacks; often targeted as it's used to request data from a specified resource. |
| `POST`    | Commonly exploited for injecting malicious data or commands as it sends data to a server to create/update a resource. |
| `PUT`     | Misused to upload files or data to the server; can lead to unauthorized file uploads if not properly secured. |
| `DELETE`  | If not properly secured, it can be abused to remove critical data or files from the server. |
| `HEAD`    | Similar to `GET` but only requests the headers; can be exploited for reconnaissance without triggering logging mechanisms as clearly as `GET`. |
| `OPTIONS` | Can reveal information about the server's capabilities and configurations, potentially exposing vulnerabilities. |
| `TRACE`   | Used to echo back input for diagnostic purposes; can be exploited in Cross-Site Tracing (XST) attacks to steal information like cookies. |
| `CONNECT` | Meant for use with proxies, but can be abused to set up unauthorized network tunnels if the server is misconfigured. |
| `PATCH`   | Used for partial modifications to resources; if not properly validated, it can lead to data corruption or unauthorized data manipulation. |
| `COPY`    | Part of the WebDAV extension; can be abused to duplicate files or data, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or server overload. |
